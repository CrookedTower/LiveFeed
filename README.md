## You’re All in This Together
You are a crew member on BEGONE!, a floundering supernatural investigation series. You and your fellow crew members travel to haunted locations to investigate the sites and cleanse them of unwanted entities, and you do it all live on TV. But dust mites and creaking floorboards are only interesting for so long, and live broadcasts are expensive. The show has eaten through its budget and the audience’s attention span; unless you catch something supernatural on camera, this supernatural show is destined for the grave.
The show’s budget can cover one final investigation. Tonight you get one last site, one last broadcast, and one last chance to make BEGONE! a hit.
### Crew Orientation
All but one player will choose a Crew Member to control. The player that did not select a Crew Member will act as the Director of LiVE FEED. 
Player Characters and Role-Playing
The Crew Member you select will act as your window into the game world. When choosing a course of action in the game, you should remember that the Crew Member’s strengths and weaknesses influence an action’s chance of success or failure. By making in-game decisions based on the Crew Member’s personality and attributes rather than your own, you are role-playing.
### The Director
The Director determines how to interpret and apply the game’s rules and controls all characters and entities Crew Members encounter. The Director also provides Crew Members with clues, items, and information as they progress through the investigation. 
As the Director, be aware that some players may not be comfortable with more gruesome or violent horror elements. Discuss what level of horror your group is comfortable with ahead of time and adjust accordingly. This will help ensure everyone can enjoy LiVE FEED.
### Materials
To play LiVE FEED, players will need a 4-sided die (d4), a 6-sided die (d6), an 8-sided die (d8), a 10-sided die (d10), a 12-sided die (d12), and a 20-sided die (d20). Along with dice, players will also need a pencil and paper to track important game information. Finally, each player will need a miniature, an extra die, a coin, or some other distinctive token to represent their character on the map of the investigation site.
If your group is not using a pre-printed map, players will need a surface to draw a map of the investigation site as their Crew Members explore the location.
## Find Out What’s Inside
Supernatural Investigators confront all manner of horrors: ghosts, demons, cancellation. Are you ready to find out what you’re really made of?
-Mark Powers
### Health
A Crew Member’s Health represents their current vitality or level of injury. Crew Members lose 1 Health for every 1 damage they receive. If a Crew Member’s Health reaches 0, they die.
### Attributes
All Crew Members have 3 core attributes they rely on during an investigation: Brawn, Brains, and Bravery. 
A Crew Member’s Brawn measures their strength and athletic ability.
A Crew Member’s Brains measure their intelligence and skills of perception.
A Crew Member’s Bravery measures their mental fortitude and courage.
Each attribute is assigned a die representing the Crew Member’s skill level or ability (d4, d6, d8, etc.). When a Crew Member is asked to perform a Skill Test using that attribute, this is the die they will roll to determine their success or failure.
### Hype
Hype represents the audience’s current excitement and investment in the broadcast. Each broadcast starts at Hype Level 0 and may increase up to Hype Level 3 over the course of the investigation. Hype Level increases at the following hype values:
Level 0 @ 0 hype
Level 1 @ 20 hype
Level 2 @ 60 hype
Level 3 @ 100 hype
As the Hype Level for the broadcast increases, the BEGONE! Crew gains new abilities. Each Crew Member begins with a passive talent at Hype Level 0 and unlocks a new unique talent every time hype for the broadcast reaches the next level. Crew Members gain hype by performing the following actions:
•	Succeeding on a Bravery Test: + 2 hype
•	Activating a supernatural Node: + 10 hype
•	Recording a supernatural Event: +5 hype
•	Capturing the Entity on film for the first time: +5 hype
•	Solving the site’s mystery, including the Entity’s identity and the chain of events that transpired there: +50 hype 
Additionally, the Director may award +2 hype at any time for uniquely dramatic, descriptive, or engaging role-play.
## There’s No Time to Waste
Time is money. Air time is even more money, so get in there and go scare up some ghosts!
-Carmen Torres
### The Investigation Round
Each Crew Member can take 3 actions during a round, and the team of Crew Members may take actions in any order. Once a Crew Member has taken their 3 actions, they may not take any more actions during the current round. When all Crew Members have taken their 3 actions, the round ends and a new Investigation Round begins.
Crew Members may use an action to:
•	Move up to 2 areas
•	Survey an area by making a Brains Test
•	Interact with a chosen Point of Interest
•	Hide behind, in, or under a Point of Interest in their current area
•	Make a Brawn Test to construct or remove a barricade 
•	Activate or use an item
## Take This, You’ll Need It
If it’s not on camera, it didn’t happen, and you don’t want to come up empty-handed.
-Steven Richards
A Crew Member may carry up to 5 stored items at a time, and they may hold up to 2 additional items—one in each hand. A Crew Member can pick up an item, store an item, retrieve a stored item, or exchange an item with another Crew Member freely without spending one of their three actions.  
A Crew Member must be holding an item to use it. Items with a “while active” effect must remain held or the item’s active effect ends. 
## It’s You or Them
Difficulty Values
Easy	2
Medium	3
Hard	4
Very Hard	5
This wasn’t in the job description.
-Alicia Caligree
When a Crew Member attempts an action where their success or failure is uncertain, they must make a Skill Test to determine the outcome. Skill Tests are always written as (Relevant attribute) Test. For example, a Brawn Test is a Skill Test using the Crew Member’s Brawn die. 
To make a Skill Test, the acting Crew Member rolls the die listed for the relevant attribute. The Crew Member’s action is successful if the value of the roll is equal to or greater than the test’s difficulty value; otherwise, the Crew Member’s attempt is a failure.
Attacks
Any Skill Test targeting a person or creature is an Attack. To resolve an Attack, both the attacker and the target(s) roll the relevant attribute die. An Attack succeeds against a target if the value of the attacker’s roll is equal to or greater than the value of the opposing roll. If the target’s roll is the greater value, they have successfully defended themselves.
### Aided And Hindered
Aid and Hindrance are special modifiers that represent the circumstances of an Attack or Skill Test, such as making a Brawn Test using an appropriate tool or making a Brains Test under extreme duress.
When a Crew Member makes an aided attack or Skill Test, they may roll the die one step larger than their attribute’s listed die. While making a hindered attack or Skill Test, the Crew Member must use the die one step smaller than their attribute’s listed die. For example, a Crew Member with a d6 for Brawn uses a crowbar to open a locked door. When rolling their Brawn Test aided by the crowbar, they will roll a d8 rather than the d6.
## Nowhere is Safe
It’s a HAUNTED location, of course people die here.
-Madison Miller	
An investigation site is split into distinct areas that the BEGONE! Crew may occupy, survey, and move between. Each area contains Points of Interest, including entryways. An area’s entryways designate the points where a person or Entity may enter, exit, or see into the area. Entryways may be barricaded or locked, which renders them unusable.
Some areas may limit the number of Crew Members that can occupy that space simultaneously. While an area is at its maximum occupancy, other Crew Members may not enter that area. Unless stated otherwise, any number of Crew Members may occupy an area.
Crew Members can only hear other Crew Members speaking while they are in the same area. A Crew Member can be heard shouting up to 3 areas away.
### Light & Vision
While in darkness, Crew Members cannot see and are Hindered for all Skill Tests. No hype is rewarded for supernatural events that occur in darkness.
While in dim light, Crew Member attacks are Hindered and hype-rewarding supernatural activity only rewards half as much hype. An area with 2 sources of dim light becomes fully lit.
## The Only Way to Save Yourself
Look out! No, really, look out—you’re in my shot.
-Anthony Jackson
The Director provides descriptions of areas as the BEGONE! Crew discovers them, informing the Crew Members of each area’s obvious Points of Interest. A Point of Interest is anything in the area with the potential for meaningful interaction. Examples of a possible Point of Interest could be a nightstand, a hanging picture, a discolored wall, or a bloodstain. 
Some areas may have secret Points of Interest that Crew Members can interact with if they discover them.
### Surveying an Area
Crew Members may use one action to survey an area for its secret Points of Interest. To survey an area, the acting Crew Member must make a Brains Test, which the Director compares against the difficulty value of all secret Points of Interest in that area. If the Crew Member’s roll is greater than or equal to the difficulty value, they discover the Point of Interest.
Some secret Points of Interest are associated with phenomena that can be detected by investigative equipment. When Crew Members use a piece of equipment to investigate an area, they automatically discover any secret Points of Interest that have phenomena associated with the active piece of equipment. For example, investigating while holding a UV light might reveal hidden bloodstains, or holding a thermal camera may reveal a supernatural cold spot.
Interacting With a Point of Interest
To interact with a Point of Interest, a Crew Member must use an action to declare the Point of Interest they are interacting with and how they are interacting with it. If their chosen Point of Interest interaction would reveal a clue or item, the Crew Member discovers it automatically, as narrated by the Director.
Some Point of Interest interactions may require a Skill Test. Physically exerting interactions, such as moving a desk or bookshelf, typically require a Brawn Test. Sometimes, a Crew Member must first summon the grit, willpower, or courage to act. Interactions with gruesome or frightening Points of Interest typically require the Crew Member to succeed on a Bravery Test before attempting the action. If the Crew Member fails the Bravery Test, they spend their action but do not interact with the Point of Interest. 
## You are Not Alone
I feel a presence. Something happened here, and this lamp remembers.  
-Kathrine Nelson
As the BEGONE! Crew spends more time at the investigation site, they will begin experiencing supernatural Events. These happenings are often innocuous at first, a door closing on its own, a book falling off a shelf. But as the night progresses and the Crew Members delve deeper into the site’s dark past, Events become more aggressive, dangerous, and intentional. Something doesn’t want them there.
### The Event Table
The Event Table represents the growing supernatural activity of the investigation site. At the end of each Investigation Round, the Director rolls a single d20 and consults the Event Table to determine what Event occurs. The Director increases the value of this die roll by 1 each round. For example, at the end of the third round, the Director will roll a d20 and add 2 to the rolled value. They will add 3 on the fourth round, 4 on the fifth round, and so on.
Lower entries on the Event Table are typically neutral or informative atmospheric Events, where later entries are often dangerous or outright deadly. The Crew Members’ early encounters with the Entity will likely come as an end-of-round Event, given that many of the later entries on an investigation’s Event Table are actions taken by the evil Entity itself. The longer the BEGONE! Crew takes to complete their investigation and stop the Entity, the more dangerous the site and Entity become.
### Supernatural Nodes
Supernatural Nodes are areas of concentrated supernatural activity that Crew Members must discover, examine, and activate to learn critical information. There are two types of Nodes: residual Nodes, which act as an echo or replay of a past event, and intelligent Nodes, which actively respond to a Crew Member’s physical or verbal interactions.
Supernatural Nodes typically exist in the areas where a significant event occurred in the past, such as the scene of a traumatic death or where a meaningful object was located. A frequently used reading chair in the study or a fireplace where someone was murdered with a fire poker are examples of possible Nodes. Crew Members must use information from their briefing and clues uncovered during the investigation to locate a site’s supernatural Nodes.
Each supernatural Node has its own activation criteria, though they typically require at least one of the following:
•	Calling the name of the person associated with that Node
•	Speaking a particular phrase or question
•	Replicating the environmental conditions present at the Node’s formation. 
•	Reenacting the Node’s creation event
## Nothing is as it Seems
There is no other possible explanation for this irrefutable evidence captured for the first time on live TV!
-Mark Powers
The supernatural comes in many varieties. Supernatural phenomena can be as simple as a closed door opening on its own. Other forms of evidence might be a bit more challenging to capture. A Crew Member might need to speak a specific phrase to provoke a phantom response only audible when listening to the recorded audio.
### Electronic Voice Phenomena
Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP) are unexplainable sounds and disembodied voices captured on audio recording devices. Sounds captured in EVPs are not audible while the Crew Member is recording and are only discoverable during playback. EVPs most often occur in response to a Crew Member speaking or performing some action. Crew Members will need a tape recorder or an electronic recorder with a high-fidelity microphone to capture EVPs.
### Electromagnetic Fields
Electromagnetic fields (EMFs) are energy fields that exhibit localized fluctuations while a supernatural or otherworldly Entity is present. Crew Members will need an EMF meter to detect EMF fluctuations.
### Supernatural Photography
Supernatural photography uses a camera to capture an image of a figure, object, or person who was otherwise invisible to the naked eye. The most common phenomenon captured on camera is the “spirit orb,” a small ball of light thought to be caused by residual supernatural energy. Crew Members will need a camera to capture supernatural photographs. Some supernatural phenomena can be captured on any camera, while others require a Crew Member to use a thermal or ultraviolet camera.
### Ultraviolet Residue
Ultraviolet residue is any substance that glows brightly under UV light, such as bacteria, blood, or ectoplasm. Crew Members must use a UV light or UV camera to detect ultraviolet residue. They must then succeed on a Brains Test to identify the substance.
Localized Hot or Cold Spots
One of the most common supernatural phenomena is a small pocket of differing temperatures. These Hot or Cold spots are noticeably warmer or cooler than ambient temperature and are generally believed to mark the location of a supernatural presence in the area. Crew Members can detect these temperature changes without equipment, but they will need to use an infrared thermometer or thermal camera to broadcast them to the audience. 
### Radio Waves
The presence of supernatural energy may disturb or even generate abnormal radio waves. A Crew Member can detect these waves by using an AM/FM radio and scanning through the various radio frequency bands. In rare circumstances, the abnormal waves may produce an EVP-like effect. For example, a Crew Member scanning with an AM/FM radio may hear a phrase spoken in the white noise between radio stations. 
### Infrasound
Infrasound is any sound pitched too low to be detected by the human ear. Infrasound has been associated with feelings of fear and discomfort and may indicate a supernatural presence. Crew Members can detect infrasound using an infrasound monitor.
### Abnormal Magnetic Fields
The presence of supernatural or otherworldly energies may cause abnormal fluctuations in local magnetic fields. These anomalies are often associated with feelings of dizziness and disorientation. Crew Members can detect these magnetic fluctuations using a compass.
### Radiation
Radiation is a type of energy emitted from materials containing naturally-occurring radioactive elements like radium, uranium, and thorium. Detecting radiation on a non-radioactive material means it may have come into contact with the supernatural or other high-energy substance. Crew Members can detect radioactivity using a Geiger counter.
## There’s Something Wicked Here
You’re here to exercise the entities; I’m here to exorcise them.
-Father Joseph Clarke
As the BEGONE! Crew continues to disturb the site and its inhabitants, they will ultimately come face to face with the dark power which dwells there. The Entity haunting a site may be a vile creature, a malicious spirit, a malevolent demon, or any number of the other sinister beings lurking on the fringes of our reality. The Entity may have caused the tragedies that occurred at the investigation site, or the trauma of those tragedies may have birthed it. The Crew Members must first find a way to weaken the Entity before they have any hope of defeating this evil; otherwise, they may find themselves the haunted site’s newest inhabitants.
### Making the Entity Vulnerable
Before the Entity is made vulnerable, it is invisible to the Crew Members unless an end-of-round Event causes it to act. It also cannot fall below 1 Health or be defeated before being made vulnerable. 
Each Entity has unique requirements that must be satisfied to make it vulnerable. Exposing its vulnerability typically requires Crew Members to perform at least one of the following:
•	Expose the Entity to a particular object, symbol, or icon
•	Use the Entity’s name or identifier in a specific phrase or ritual
•	Alter or destroy an object linked to the Entity
Once the BEGONE! Crew has made the Entity vulnerable, the Director no longer rolls on the Event Table. The final race for survival has begun
### The Race to Survive
Once it is made vulnerable, the Director assumes direct control of the Entity as it desperately fights against the Crew Members’ attempts to destroy it. During an Investigation Round, the Entity takes one action after every third Crew Member action. At the end of each Investigation Round, the Entity recovers 1 Health.
If the Crew Members reduce the Entity to 0 Health while it is vulnerable, it will immediately retreat to regain Health (at a rate of 4 Health per round). Unless otherwise specified by the Entity’s vulnerability requirements, the Crew Members cannot find or damage the Entity further during this time.
Each Entity has a unique procedure Crew Members must complete to permanently kill or banish it. Some may be as simple as reducing the Entity’s Health to 0; others may require the Crew Members to perform a complex ritual or physically destroy the Entity’s body.
## A Textbook Case
I read about this in Algernon Trundle’s Field Guide to Phantasmagoric Phenomena. A little salt, a silver dagger, and a teensy bit of blood will have us right as rain. Anyone have some spare sage?  
-Harper Klein
A LiVE FEED broadcast is broken into 4 sections: Pre-production and 3 ‘Acts’ that form a cohesive narrative that players can experience in a single 3 to 4 hour play session. There are no hard act breaks in a LiVE FEED broadcast; the Director should progress the story naturally, with each act unfolding into the next as the BEGONE! Crew works toward their goal: defeating the Entity to save the show and survive the night.
### Pre-production
To begin a LiVE FEED broadcast, the Director reads the investigation brief to the BEGONE! Crew and gives them $200, the very last of the show’s budget.
The BEGONE! producers have provided the Crew with the following equipment:
•	A high-definition video camera
•	3 CCTV cameras
•	2 flashlights
•	2 walkie talkies
•	A tape recorder
•	An EMF meter
•	An infrared thermometer
•	A UV light
The Crew Members may spend the $200 to purchase any additional supplies they’d like for the investigation. Additionally, some Crew Members begin the investigation with a piece of personal equipment.
The BEGONE! Crew and all of their equipment begin at the Monitoring Station located at the main entrance to the investigation site. The monitoring station is supervised by Travis Dupont, the A/V technician for BEGONE! Travis is a wheelchair user and stays at the monitoring station at all times during the investigation. Travis is controlled by the Director and communicates with the investigation team via walkie-talkie to relay information such as anomalies picked up on camera feeds and audience hype building around the broadcast.
Once Travis has set up the Monitoring Station, and the Crew Members have equipped themselves for the investigation, the Director sets the scene with a short narrative that provides the BEGONE! Crew with their first official introduction to the investigation site. This concludes pre-production; it’s time to roll camera.
### Act I: Discovery
During this first act, the Crew Members use actions to explore the site setting up equipment and searching for clues, hints, or items that could prove vital to their investigation. In this act, the Crew should focus on uncovering the history of the site—particularly details on the people who lived there and tragedies that befell them. Crew Members should set up surveillance equipment in the areas they feel are most “active” to capture any supernatural events that may occur there while the Crew Members are exploring other locations at the site.
At the end of the second Investigation Round, the Director rolls a d20 and checks the outcome against the investigation’s Event Table to determine what supernatural activity occurs. This table contains neutral, beneficial, and harmful supernatural Events, including actions from the evil Entity itself. The Director will continue to make these rolls at the end of every round until the Entity becomes vulnerable.
### Act II: Contact
Once Crew Members have gathered enough clues, they will need to locate and activate supernatural Nodes. The Nodes will help the Crew build hype for the BEGONE! broadcast, dig up the site’s buried past, unearth essential items needed to confront the evil Entity, and learn what steps they must take to defeat it once and for all. Crew Members must be careful, though; not all Nodes are beneficial.
### Act III: Finale
During the final act, the BEGONE! Crew confronts the Entity and tries to make it out alive. To do so, Crew Members must first make the Entity vulnerable using the discoveries made in previous acts. Once the Entity is vulnerable, the Crew Members can perform the steps necessary to defeat it and “cleanse” the site permanently. The exact procedure Crew Members must follow depends on the Entity. One Entity may require Crew Members to perform specific rituals, while another requires Crew Members to speak a particular word or phrase in a specific area. Some may even require physical combat with the Entity itself.
Once the BEGONE! Crew has overcome the Entity, the Director narrates its defeat to the players. Players can then role-play a short farewell “to the camera,” wrapping up the broadcast and ending the game session. If the entire Crew should fall to the Entity, the Director narrates the Crew’s end and, perhaps, their new beginning. Players could then close the session by role-playing their Crew Members’ entrance to the afterlife as the haunted site’s newest inhabitants. 
## Your Directorial Debut
As the Director of LiVE FEED, players rely on you to make sure the game is fair and balanced and that everyone is following the rules of the game as you have arbitrated them (including you). You also act as the lens which allows players to see and experience the haunted locations through their Crew Members’ eyes. By supplying players with atmospheric and informative descriptions of their environment and the clues and items necessary to complete the investigation, you are also helping to set a tone and pace for the game. 
Without adequate description, the players will not have the details they need to make informed decisions; however, too much description can cause them to miss or lose track of critical information, or worse, stop listening altogether. The key to providing engaging descriptions is to give the players just enough. One or two short sentences to set an atmosphere and quick descriptions of an area’s Points of Interest give the players information without becoming overwhelming or tedious.
When describing a new area, discovery, Point of Interest, or Event, try to include at least one sensory descriptor, such as a smell, a sensation, or a sound. For example, instead of:
“You enter an old kitchen covered in dust and broken plates. There are long-dead potted plants on the countertops.” 
try:
“You enter a kitchen, its air so thick with dust it clumps in your throat. You hear the crunch of broken dinnerware as shards of shattered porcelain are pulverized underfoot.”
A few descriptive words that engage the senses will go a long way towards evoking an atmosphere.
### Using Pre-made Investigations
While making your own investigations is a fun way to flex your creative storytelling muscles and give your players a unique experience, it is recommended that you use a pre-written investigation if this is your first time Directing LiVE FEED.
Once you’ve decided which investigation you’re going to Direct, read through the investigation before the game session to familiarize yourself with the site’s mysteries: the Points of Interest, the Events, and the Entity your BEGONE! Crew will encounter during the broadcast.
### Investigation Layout
Each pre-made investigation begins with an introductory section containing the Crew’s brief, the investigation’s narrative, mystery solutions, hype rewards, critical items, and information about the Entity.
After the introductory section, an investigation will have 2 maps: one unmarked map for the BEGONE! Crew, and one for the Director containing markings for secret passageways, important items, and Points of Interest with something discoverable. Each of the site’s areas has its own section containing a description of the environment and all Points of Interest. The section also details the clues, items, and interactions available to Crew Member in the area.
